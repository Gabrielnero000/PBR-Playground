Hey, welcome! 

This project is the register of my Physical Based Rendering (PBR) study, experiences and interesting stuffs. I'm starting this repository with almost any knowledge in this area, so this will be a long way down in the PBR's world. I hope you enjoy this travel and fell free to question, comment and  add knowledge! 

This repository is also for educational purposes in the class "Special Topics in Computing" ministered by Dr. Christian Azambuja Pagot in the  Federal University of Para√≠ba.

## Structure
This project is subdivided in sections,   
which are listed below. Those are in constant correction (fell free to give a feedback :D ) and new sections are added constantly.

## But what is PBR?
Since the prehistoric CRT displays until actual pixel-based monitors, generate realistic images was (and still is) the main goal of the Computer Graphics (CG) research. From the efforts of lots of great professionals, today we have basically two ways to generate high quality images: **rasterization-based** methods and **physical-based** methods. The first one is the most popular method for real time rendering, specially games. Those techniques convincent results and it's computationally **fast**, but the thing is: if you look for a rasterization-generated image it's easy to know that it's an CG image. That's were physical-based techniques shines.

**Physical Based Rendering** (**PBR**) it's able to generate images extremely realistic images (check the [gallery](https://github.com/Gabrielnero000/PBR-Playground#gallery-images-of-experiments)) and it's relativelly easy to implemment, at cost of a lot of computer processing power. 

In the PBR's world the most popular techniques are **ray-based** techniques, specifically **Ray Tracing** and **Path Tracing**. Both tries to simulate the phenom of the human vision using rules from physics (that's were the "physical based" comes from).

So, to understand  how those algorithms works, we need

PBR is about genereate beautiful CG images, so here they are! The images in this section was generated using my code or existing PBR softwares. I hope you appreciate it!
