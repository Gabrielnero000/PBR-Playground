Hey, welcome! 

This project is the register of my Physical Based Rendering (PBR) study, experiences and interesting stuffs. I'm starting this repository with almost any knowledge in this area, so this will be a long way down in the PBR's world. I hope you enjoy this travel and fell free to question, comment and  add knowledge! 

This repository is also for educational purposes in the class "Special Topics in Computing" ministered by Dr. Christian Azambuja Pagot in the  Federal University of "Para√≠ba".

## Structure
This project is subdivided in sections,   
which are listed below. Those are in constant correction (fell free to give a feedback :D ) and new sections are added constantly.
