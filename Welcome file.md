Hey, welcome! 

This project is the register of my Physical Based Rendering (PBR) study, experiences and interesting stuffs. I'm starting this repository with almost any knowledge in this area, so this will be a long way down in the PBR's world. I hope you enjoy this travel and fell free to question, comment and  add knowledge! 

This repository is also in use for educational purposes in the class "Special Topics in Computing" ministered by Dr. Christian Pagot in the MIT (Mangabeira Institute of technology
